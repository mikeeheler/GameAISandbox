# Game AI Sandbox

A sandbox for me to experiment with building little games and AIs to play them using various techniques.

## Tech

* [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) using OpenGL Backend
* [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

As such it should run on Linux, MacOS and Windows. On Linux, libSDL2 is required.
