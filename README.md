# Game AI Sandbox

A sandbox for me to experiment with building little games and AIs to play them using various techniques.

## Tech

* [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) using OpenGL Backend
* [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

## Caveats

This should work on all platforms supported by MonoGame and .NET Core 3.1. In practice, however, I've only gotten it
to run on Windows. On Linux it fails to load libSDL and I CBF to figure out why.
